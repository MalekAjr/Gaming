# Gaming
# Description
This project is a gaming application developed by a team of two, using a combination of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end technology Django.

The application is designed to provide a gaming platform where users can play and interact with various games. It offers a rich user interface built with HTML and styled with CSS to ensure an engaging and visually appealing experience. JavaScript is utilized to add dynamic functionality and interactivity to the games.

The back-end of the application is powered by Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django handles the server-side logic, database management, and API integration, allowing seamless communication between the front-end and back-end components.
